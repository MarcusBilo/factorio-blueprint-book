## What is this?

This is a set of 30 Factorio blueprints for the early to mid-game of the base game. Includes belt balancers, research labs, and smelters to cover common components and streamline factory setup (v1.2).


## How to Use

- Copy the blueprint string to the clipboard.

- Import the code into Factorio:
  - Click on the string import icon <img src="https://github.com/MarcusBilo/Factorio-BluePrint-Book/blob/main/import-string-x56.png" width="24"> in the quick access bar.
  - Paste the blueprint string.
  - Add the imported blueprint book to your blueprint library (keyboard shortcut `B`).

- Use the blueprints to help build the factory. The factory must grow! üè≠
